The quintessential American cookie, perfected through countless batches.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp fine sea salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

### Add-ins
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment.
2. **Mix dry ingredients**: Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
3. **Cream butter and sugars**: Beat until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes.
4. **Add eggs**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla.
5. **Combine**: Gradually add dry ingredients. Fold in chocolate chips.
6. **Portion**: Drop rounded tablespoons onto sheets, 2 inches apart.
7. **Bake**: 10-12 minutes until edges are golden but centers look underdone.
8. **Cool**: Let cool on sheet 5 minutes before transferring to rack.

## Tips

- Room temperature ingredients ensure better emulsification
- Don't overmix after adding flour
- Underbake slightly—cookies continue cooking on the hot pan

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

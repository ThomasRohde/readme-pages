# First Note

This is a test note to verify the content collection and publishing workflow.

## Features to test

- Content collections with Zod validation
- Markdown rendering with code blocks
- Front matter metadata
- Date-based organization

## Code example

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Next steps

1. Implement ToC generation
2. Add syntax highlighting
3. Style with Tailwind

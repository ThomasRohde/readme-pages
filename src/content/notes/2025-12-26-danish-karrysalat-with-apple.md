Karrysalat is a classic Danish curry salad—most famously served with pickled herring, but just as good on rye bread or a crusty roll. This version keeps the traditional creamy base and adds **apple in very small dice** for a fresh crunch.

## Ingredients (serves 4)

### Curry mayo base
- 5 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2–3 tbsp crème fraîche (38% fat if you can get it; otherwise use a thick sour cream)
- 4–6 tsp curry powder (store-bought) **or** homemade curry blend (below)
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (for “blooming” the curry)
- Salt and black pepper
- A pinch of sugar (optional, to balance acidity)

### Mix-ins
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and diced small
- 3–4 tbsp pickled cucumbers (gherkin-style), diced small
- 1 tbsp shallot, very finely chopped
- 2 tbsp chives, finely chopped
- 1/2 small, crisp apple (e.g., Granny Smith or Pink Lady), **very small dice**

### Optional (more traditional “deluxe” version)
- 3–4 tbsp cooked cured tongue, diced small
- 2–3 tbsp sweet anchovies, chopped

## Method

1. **Make the curry mayo.**  
   Stir together the mayonnaise and crème fraîche in a bowl.

2. **Bloom the curry for better flavour.**  
   Warm the oil in a small pan over low heat. Add the curry powder and stir for 30–60 seconds until fragrant (don’t let it brown). Scrape into a small bowl and let it cool for a few minutes, then whisk it into the mayo mixture.

3. **Prep the mix-ins.**  
   Dice the eggs, pickles, and (optional) tongue/anchovies. Finely chop the shallot and chives. Dice the apple *very* small.

4. **Combine.**  
   Mix the diced ingredients together first, then fold in curry mayo a spoon at a time until the salad is as creamy as you like.

5. **Season.**  
   Taste and adjust with salt, pepper, and (if needed) a small pinch of sugar. Add a little more curry if you want it punchier, or a little more mayo/crème fraîche if you want it milder and looser.

6. **Rest (recommended).**  
   Chill 20–30 minutes so the flavours round out.

## Optional: homemade curry blend

This makes more than you’ll need for one batch (handy to keep in a jar).

### Spices
- 2 tsp dried crushed chili
- 2 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds
- 1 tbsp black peppercorns
- 1 tsp whole cloves
- 1 tsp fenugreek seeds
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- 1 tsp coarse sea salt
- 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground ginger

### How to make it
1. Toast the whole spices (chili, coriander, cumin, peppercorns, cloves, fenugreek, mustard) in a dry pan over low heat until fragrant—no colour.
2. Grind to a fine powder with the salt.
3. Stir in nutmeg, turmeric, and ginger.
4. Store airtight away from heat/light.

## Serving ideas

- **Classic:** on rye bread with pickled herring and extra chives.
- **Sandwich:** on white bread or a roll with sliced boiled eggs.
- **Party tray:** as a dip for cold boiled potatoes or roasted root veg.

## Storage

Keep refrigerated in a sealed container and use within 2–3 days. The apple stays crispest on day 1; if making ahead, you can fold in the apple just before serving.

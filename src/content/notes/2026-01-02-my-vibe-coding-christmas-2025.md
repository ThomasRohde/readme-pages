This Christmas break was something special. From December 18th through January 1st, I dove deep into code and emerged with **719 commits across 7 repositories**. No grand plan, no roadmap—just pure vibe coding, following curiosity wherever it led.

## The Numbers

- **719 commits** in two weeks
- **7 active repositories**
- Languages: TypeScript, Python, Astro, HTML
- Sleep schedule: questionable
- Coffee consumed: uncountable

## What I Built

### 🌟 Lodestar (175 commits)

**[Lodestar](https://github.com/ThomasRohde/lodestar)** became my main focus—a Python CLI tool that lets multiple AI agents (or humans) work together in the same Git repository without stepping on each other's toes. It's like a traffic controller for collaborative AI development.

The problem it solves: when you have multiple agents working on different features, they need to coordinate without creating merge chaos. Lodestar handles the orchestration, using Git worktrees and branch management to keep everyone in their lane.

Shipped with full documentation at [thomasrohde.github.io/lodestar](https://thomasrohde.github.io/lodestar/).

### 🪟 Windows15 (165 commits)

A TypeScript project that... well, let's just say I got curious about building retro Windows UIs. 165 commits worth of curious. Sometimes you just need to build something that makes you smile, and there's something deeply satisfying about recreating that classic Windows aesthetic in modern web tech.

### ⛏️ Klondike Spec CLI (142 commits)

**[The CLI that built itself](https://github.com/ThomasRohde/klondike-spec-cli)**—seriously, that's the official description. This is a meta-tool for managing AI agent workflows, created through the very methodology it implements. If that sounds recursive, that's because it is.

Think of it as project management tooling specifically designed for long-running AI agent sessions, where context needs to bridge across multiple conversation windows and sessions.

### 🔄 SyncToy (107 commits)

A TypeScript utility I built in a couple of days (December 22-23). Sometimes you just need a better file sync tool, so you build one. TypeScript makes quick prototyping surprisingly pleasant when you're in the flow.

### 📄 readme-pages (101 commits)

This very site you're reading! An Astro + Tailwind static site for publishing my notes and thoughts. I spent the holiday break refining it, improving the dark mode, tweaking the layouts, and generally making it a pleasant place to write and read.

### 🕵️ lsspy (28 commits)

Created December 30th, this HTML-based tool scratched a very specific itch. Sometimes the best tools are the simple ones that solve one problem really well.

### 📚 audiobooker (1 commit)

Started on New Year's Day—a Python project that's just getting off the ground. Too early to say what it'll become, but that's the fun of vibe coding: you start something, see where it goes.

## The Vibe Coding Philosophy

This Christmas reminded me why I love coding:

**No pressure, just progress.** No deadlines, no stakeholders, no meetings. Just me, an editor, and problems I wanted to solve.

**Follow the energy.** Jumped between projects based on what felt interesting in the moment. 175 commits on Lodestar one week, 165 on Windows15 another. The point isn't to finish—it's to enjoy the process.

**Build tools that build tools.** Both Lodestar and Klondike are meta-tools for working with AI agents. They make my future coding sessions more productive, which means more time for creative work.

**Ship it.** Getting Lodestar documented and published felt great. If code sits on your hard drive, it's just a hobby. Publishing it makes it real.

## Tech Stack Highlights

- **TypeScript** for web UIs and CLI tools
- **Python** for AI orchestration and system utilities
- **Astro + Tailwind** for this static site
- **Git worktrees** as a core abstraction in Lodestar
- **GitHub CLI** for automation and exploration

## What I Learned

1. **AI agent workflows need better tooling.** Lodestar and Klondike emerged from real frustration with coordinating multi-agent development. 

2. **Small commits are underrated.** 719 commits means lots of small, incremental changes. Each one compiles, each one works. It makes everything easier—reverting, understanding, collaborating.

3. **Side projects need variety.** Jumping between Python, TypeScript, and Astro kept things fresh. When I got stuck on one thing, I'd switch contexts and come back with fresh eyes.

4. **Documentation matters.** Building the Lodestar docs site wasn't glamorous, but it made the project real. Good docs = project people can actually use.

5. **Vibe coding is productive.** No roadmap, no sprints, no story points—just following curiosity. And somehow I built more in two weeks than I usually do in a month of "proper" planning.

## What's Next

- **Lodestar**: Already getting ideas for v2 features
- **Klondike**: More integration with AI workflows
- **audiobooker**: Curious where this one will go
- **readme-pages**: Keep writing, keep refining

But honestly? I'm not planning too far ahead. That's the beauty of vibe coding—you discover what to build by building it.

## Final Thoughts

This Christmas break proved something I've suspected for a while: the best code I write is the code I write for myself, driven by curiosity rather than requirements.

No product managers, no quarterly goals, no OKRs. Just problems I wanted to solve, tools I wanted to exist, and ideas I wanted to explore.

That's vibe coding.

And honestly? It felt great.

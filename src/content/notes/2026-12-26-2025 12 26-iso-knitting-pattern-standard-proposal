The global knitting community faces a persistent challenge: patterns written in one region often require translation, conversion charts, and guesswork when used by crafters elsewhere. A Danish knitter following a Japanese charted pattern, an American attempting a British design, or a German using Australian yarn must navigate conflicting terminology, incompatible measurements, and ambiguous symbols. This proposal outlines a comprehensive ISO standard to unify these disparate systems while preserving the rich traditions each represents.

## Scope and Objectives

ISO 24700 would establish a universal framework for knitting pattern documentation, covering terminology, measurements, notation, and digital interchange formats. The standard aims to eliminate ambiguity without forcing abandonment of regional conventions, enabling patterns to be written once and understood globally.

The primary objectives include harmonizing stitch terminology across English-speaking regions, establishing metric as the primary measurement system with standardized conversion protocols, adopting a unified symbol set for charted patterns based on Japanese conventions, creating machine-readable pattern formats for digital tools, and defining yarn weight and needle size classifications that map to existing regional systems.

## Part 1: Terminology Standardization

### The Current State of Confusion

The same stitch can have entirely different names depending on where the pattern originates. What Americans call "stockinette stitch" is "stocking stitch" in the UK. More problematically, "moss stitch" in the UK is "seed stitch" in the US, while American "moss stitch" is British "double moss stitch." The term "bind off" (US) becomes "cast off" (UK), and "gauge" transforms into "tension."

### Proposed Resolution

ISO 24700 would establish canonical terminology with mandatory regional annotations. Each term would have a primary form (generally the more descriptive option) with parenthetical alternatives where confusion is likely.

The standard would define core stitches using the following format: the canonical term followed by regional variants in parentheses. For example, *stockinette stitch (UK: stocking stitch)* would be the standard entry for flat knitting with alternating knit and purl rows creating a V-pattern on the right side. Similarly, *bind off (UK: cast off)* would describe securing stitches to prevent unraveling.

For stitches with completely different names, the standard would specify both with cross-references. The confusion between seed and moss stitch would be resolved by defining "alternating stitch" (US: seed stitch; UK: moss stitch) for single-unit checkerboard patterns and "extended alternating stitch" (US: moss stitch; UK: double moss stitch) for the two-row variant.

### Abbreviation Normalization

A standardized abbreviation table would replace the current chaos. Core abbreviations would include K (knit), P (purl), YO (yarn over), replacing the British YON/YRN/YFWD variants, K2tog (knit two together), SSK (slip slip knit), BO (bind off/cast off), and CO (cast on).

Regional patterns could continue using local abbreviations but would be required to include a mapping table to ISO abbreviations.

## Part 2: Measurement Framework

### Metric as Primary, Imperial as Annotation

ISO 24700 would establish the metric system as the canonical measurement system for all pattern specifications. Imperial measurements (yards, inches) would be permitted as secondary annotations but never as the sole specification.

Gauge specifications would follow a standard format: *22 stitches × 28 rows = 10 cm × 10 cm (4" × 4") on 4.0 mm needles*. This format provides the metric measurement first, imperial in parentheses, and needle size in millimeters only.

### Needle Size Unification

The current situation involves three incompatible systems. US sizes run from 0 to 50 with larger numbers indicating larger needles. UK/Canadian sizes run from 14 to 000 with larger numbers indicating smaller needles. Japanese sizes use a completely different metric scale starting at 2.1 mm.

The standard would mandate metric (millimeter) sizing as the canonical specification. Patterns must list needle size as the actual diameter in millimeters, with regional equivalents permitted in parentheses: *4.0 mm (US 6 / UK 8)*.

A normative annex would provide the complete conversion table, but the millimeter measurement would be the legal specification.

### Yarn Weight Classification

Building on the Craft Yarn Council's work, ISO 24700 would establish an eight-category yarn weight system with standardized gauge ranges and recommended needle sizes.

| Category | Name | Gauge (st/10cm) | Needle (mm) |
|----------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Lace | 33-40 | 1.5-2.25 |
| 1 | Superfine | 27-32 | 2.25-3.25 |
| 2 | Fine | 23-26 | 3.25-3.75 |
| 3 | Light | 21-24 | 3.75-4.5 |
| 4 | Medium | 16-20 | 4.5-5.5 |
| 5 | Bulky | 12-15 | 5.5-8.0 |
| 6 | Super Bulky | 7-11 | 8.0-12.75 |
| 7 | Jumbo | 6 or fewer | 12.75+ |

Regional terminology (UK ply weights, Australian nomenclature) would map to these categories via a normative annex.

## Part 3: Charted Pattern Notation

### Japanese System as Foundation

Japanese knitting patterns have long used a sophisticated charted notation system that transcends language barriers. ISO 24700 would adopt this approach as the primary method for stitch pattern representation, with written instructions as a supplementary option.

The Japanese system's strengths include visual representation matching the finished fabric, standardized symbols with near-universal recognition within Japan, compact notation for complex patterns, and language independence.

### Core Symbol Set

The standard would define a mandatory core symbol set for the most common operations:

- Empty square or vertical line: Knit on RS, Purl on WS
- Horizontal dash: Purl on RS, Knit on WS
- Circle: Yarn over
- Right-leaning diagonal: K2tog
- Left-leaning diagonal: SSK
- Crossed lines: Cable symbols with direction indicated

The full symbol library would cover approximately 100 standard operations, with an extension mechanism for proprietary or regional techniques.

### Chart Reading Direction

Charts would read from bottom to top (matching the direction of knitting), right to left for right-side rows, and left to right for wrong-side rows when working flat. Row numbers would appear on the side where the row begins.

## Part 4: Pattern Structure

### Mandatory Sections

Every ISO 24700-compliant pattern would include the following sections in order:

1. **Header**: Pattern name, designer, version, ISO 24700 compliance level
2. **Materials**: Yarn specification (weight category, fiber, meterage), needle sizes, notions
3. **Gauge**: Standard format with swatch instructions
4. **Sizes**: Available sizes with finished measurements
5. **Abbreviations**: Mapping to ISO abbreviations where non-standard terms are used
6. **Instructions**: Written or charted, with section markers for garment pieces
7. **Finishing**: Assembly, blocking, and care instructions

### Size Grading

Multi-size patterns would present information using a consistent format. The first size would appear unbracketed, subsequent sizes in parentheses, in the same order throughout the pattern. A size key would appear at the pattern start, mapping size designations to finished measurements.

Example: *CO 80 (88, 96, 104) sts* with key *XS (S, M, L): 81 (89, 97, 105) cm finished bust*.

## Part 5: Digital Interchange Format

### KnitML: A Machine-Readable Standard

ISO 24700 would define KnitML (Knitting Markup Language), an XML-based format for digital pattern interchange. This would enable pattern design software, knitting machines, and assistive tools to consume patterns programmatically.

A basic KnitML structure would encode pattern metadata, materials specifications, stitch dictionaries, and row-by-row instructions in a hierarchical format. The schema would support both written instructions and charted notation, with automatic conversion between formats where possible.

### Benefits for Digital Tools

Standardized digital formats would enable pattern management software to validate compliance, digital assistants to read patterns aloud with consistent terminology, automatic generation of shopping lists and project trackers, machine knitting systems to consume hand-knitting patterns, and accessibility tools for visually impaired knitters.

## Part 6: Compliance Levels

The standard would define three compliance levels, allowing incremental adoption:

**Level 1 (Basic)** requires metric measurements as primary, ISO abbreviation mapping provided, and standard gauge format used.

**Level 2 (Intermediate)** requires all Level 1 requirements plus charted notation for stitch patterns, standardized size grading format, and all mandatory sections present.

**Level 3 (Full)** requires all Level 2 requirements plus KnitML digital version provided, complete symbol set conformance, and validation by accredited testing body.

Patterns could display a compliance mark indicating their level, enabling crafters to identify internationally accessible designs.

## Implementation Roadmap

The standard's development would proceed through ISO's normal technical committee process, likely under TC 38 (Textiles) or a new committee specific to craft documentation. Key stakeholders would include the Craft Yarn Council, major pattern publishers (Vogue Knitting, Interweave, Japanese publishing houses), yarn manufacturers, and digital platform providers (Ravelry, LoveCrafts).

A transition period of five years would allow existing patterns to add compliance annotations and new patterns to adopt the standard progressively. Educational materials would help independent designers understand and implement the requirements.

## What To Do Next

- Review the Craft Yarn Council's existing standards as a baseline for yarn weight and gauge specifications
- Survey major pattern databases to quantify the scope of terminology conflicts
- Engage with Japanese Vogue and other Asian publishers who have pioneered chart-based notation
- Draft the KnitML schema with input from software developers
- Propose the standard through national standards bodies for ISO consideration
- Develop a pilot program with willing publishers to test compliance processes

The Craft Yarn Council has established voluntary guidelines for yarn labeling and pattern formatting at craftyarncouncil.com/standards, providing a foundation for the yarn weight classification proposed here. Analysis of terminology differences draws from extensive documentation of US/UK conflicts across pattern databases and knitting community forums. The Japanese charted notation system is documented in works like Hitomi Shida's *Japanese Knitting Stitch Bible* and through resources maintained by translators bridging Japanese and Western knitting communities.

The quintessential American cookie, perfected through countless batches. These cookies strike the ideal balance between chewy centers and slightly crispy edges.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2¼ cups (280g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp fine sea salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 1 cup (2 sticks / 225g) unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar
- ¾ cup (165g) packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Add-ins
- 2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, beat softened butter with both sugars until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. **Add eggs**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract. Mix until combined.

5. **Combine**: Gradually add dry ingredients to wet, mixing on low speed until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips.

6. **Portion**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.

7. **Bake**: Bake for 10-12 minutes, until edges are golden but centers look slightly underdone.

8. **Cool**: Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

## Tips

- **Room temperature ingredients** ensure better emulsification and a more uniform texture
- **Don't overmix** after adding flour—this develops gluten and makes cookies tough
- **Underbake slightly**—cookies continue cooking on the hot pan after removal
- For **extra chewy cookies**, chill dough for 30 minutes before baking

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. Freeze baked cookies for up to 3 months.

Potatoes Romanoff are the “lighter than mashed” steakhouse potato: bake first, chill, shred, then gently fold with cheese and sour cream so it bakes up airy with a browned top.

## Ingredients (8 servings)

- Butter for the dish: **1 tsp / 5 g**, plus extra as needed
- Russet potatoes (scrubbed): **3 large (about 1.2 kg / 2.6 lb)**
- Shallots, very finely minced: **1/4 cup / 40 g**
- Kosher salt: **3 tsp (about 15–18 g)**
- White pepper, freshly ground: **1/2 tsp / 1 g**
- Cayenne pepper: **1 pinch (about 1/16 tsp / 0.1 g)**, or to taste
- Sharp white Cheddar, grated: **2 1/2 cups / 280 g (about 10 oz)**
- Sour cream: **1 3/4 cups / 420 g (about 15 oz)**

## Instructions

1. **Bake the potatoes**: Heat oven to **400°F / 200°C**. Poke a few holes in each potato, wrap each in foil, and bake on a tray until very tender, **about 1 hour 15 minutes**.
2. **Cool and chill (key step)**: Let potatoes cool to room temp. Unwrap, cover, and refrigerate until fully chilled, **8 hours to overnight**.
3. **Prep to bake**: Heat oven to **425°F / 220°C**. Butter a **2–3 L (2–3 qt)** casserole or gratin dish.
4. **Shred**: Keep the skins on. Using a box grater, **shred the cold potatoes** into a large bowl.
5. **Season**: Add minced shallots, kosher salt, white pepper, and cayenne. Toss gently with two forks to distribute without compacting.
6. **Add cheese**: Toss in the grated Cheddar until evenly mixed.
7. **Fold in sour cream (don’t overmix)**: Add sour cream and **gently** fold until *just* combined—stop as soon as you don’t see large white streaks.
8. **Fill the dish**: Transfer to the buttered dish. Pile it up high, then **pat very lightly** (avoid packing it down).
9. **Bake**: Bake until piping hot and browned on top, **30–35 minutes**. Rest **5–10 minutes** before serving.

## Tips and variations

- **Salt reality check**: Kosher salt brands vary a lot. Start with **2 tsp**, taste a small pinch of the mixture, then add the last tsp if needed.
- **Milder shallot flavor**: If you’re sensitive to raw shallot, sauté the minced shallot in a little butter until translucent; cool completely before mixing in.
- **Cheese swap**: Sharp white Cheddar is classic here, but Gruyère (or a 50/50 mix) works well.
- **Make-ahead**: You can bake and chill the potatoes a day ahead. You can also assemble the casserole, cover, and refrigerate up to **24 hours**; bake straight from the fridge, adding **5–10 minutes** if needed.

## Storage and reheating

- Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to **3 days**.
- Reheat covered at **350°F / 175°C** until hot through (uncover for the last few minutes to re-crisp the top).

## What to do next

- Pick a baking dish that lets you mound the potatoes **high** (more height = better browned top).
- If you’re unsure about salt, season in two passes and **taste-check** before baking.
- Pair with steak, roast chicken, or a crisp green salad to cut the richness.
- Make notes on your preferred cheese blend and shallot intensity for the next batch.
